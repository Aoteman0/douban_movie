你表妹我就不考虑了
I'm not considering your cousin,

334
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,833
要考虑就考虑你

00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,417
哦哟，你真的是，不要开这种玩笑哈

这高一入学工作都块结束了

我今天来就是为了解决这个问题的

00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,452
学杂费和住宿费你看一下
Take a look at the fees for tuition and accommodation.

342

00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,267
还有个住宿费？
Why is there an accommodation fee?

344
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,875
马依依申请学校住校啊
Yiyi applied for school housing.

345
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,563
她说和你商量过的
She said she's discussed it with you.

346
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,125
你不知道啊？
Don't you know that?

347
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,292
一千...八百五？
One thousand eight hundred and fifty?

348
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,000
我们都是按标准收费的
We always charge by standards,

349
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,292

最近我是...手头比较紧
My budget is a bit tight recently.

357
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,667
买了个房子嘛
I just bought a flat.

358
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:00,489
你有钱买房没钱交学费啊？
So you have money for a flat but not for the tuition fee?

359
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,125
我先打个欠条
I'll write you an IOU.

360
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,083
我要你欠条做啥子...
I don't want your IOU.

361
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,750
我们要收的是学费
We need the tuition fee.

362
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,583
你要相信我嘛
You gotta trust me.

363
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,375
不是信不信的问题
It has nothing to do with trust.

364
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,958
要是家长都像你这样
Our school's gonna shut down,

365
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,333
那我们学校啷个办下去？
If all parents are like you.

366
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,125
学费，学费
The tuition fee

367
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,416
她要是学好了
Will definitely be paid,

368
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:16,917
我肯定交嘛
If she studies well.

369
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,042
你这话啥子意思
What do you mean?

370
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,250
等于是...
So,

371
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,999
她学不好你就不交学费咯？
You won't pay if she doesn't study well?

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,374
我不是这个意思!
That's not what I mean!

373
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,458
那你啥子意思?
What do you mean then?

374
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:26,917
你啥子意思嘛?
What do you mean?

375
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:29,183
啊呀...

376
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,792
吴老师，吴老师

382
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,500
洒了
They fell off.

383
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,042
哎呀...
Too bad.

384
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,000
咋子了嘛？
What happened?

385
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,958
依依。
Yiyi.

386
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,458

What did he do to you?

387
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:53,312
过来！
Come here!

388
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,375

过来！
Come here!

390
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,809
跑啥子跑
That's what you get,

391
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,028
跑啥子跑
When you run away.

392
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:03,042
跑啥子跑
When you run away.

393
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:03,793
跑啥子跑
why did you run?

394
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,083
马叔叔，你给我个面子
Uncle Ma, please do me a favour.

395
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,083

哪一个给老子贴的罚单？
Who stuck this ticket?

老黄
Huang,

427
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,166
那个马先勇和我们队长
How exactly is that Ma

428
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,624
到底是啥子关系嘛
Related to our captain?

429
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,625
那个马先勇....
That Ma Xianyong

430
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:39,792
以前还算是个不错的人
Was quite a good guy before.

431
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,667
就是命不好
He just had a bad luck.

432
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,458
那个时候...我们队长
When our captain

433
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,583
刚刚从公安大学毕业
Just graduated from the police academy,

434
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,142
到派出所
He was assigned to our station

435
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:48,250
带的那个协警
With an auxiliary police officer.

436
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,125
这是他
That was him.

437
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,750
老马搞协警拼的很，不要命
Ma worked very hard and was brave as a lion.

438
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,840
也帮队长破了一些案子
He also helped the captain solving some cases.

439
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,583
吃亏就吃亏在，没得啥子文化
But unfortunately he wasn't well educated,

440
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,792
一个公务员转正
He tried the civil service test

441
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,167
考了四五年
For over four or five years.

442
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,875
好不容易考起了
When he finally passed the test,

443
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,375
-然后咧？ -队长结婚办酒
Ma got himself dead drunk

444
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,042
老马喝的一塌糊涂
At our captain's wedding.

445
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,250
但哪个晓得
But you know what,

446
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,340
喝醉了他还非要开车
He insisted on driving after drinking so much.

447
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,833
刚过个路口，就撞了
The car crashed just over the crossing,

448
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:14,708
120都还没到
His wife passed away

449
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,208
他的老婆，就没得了
Before the ambulance arrived.

450
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:21,023
咋还有人取现？
Why are there people taking cash out?

451
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,833
这儿是银行哒嘛
Of course, it's a bank.

452
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,583
只准存不准取嗦？
Deposit only, no withdrawal?

453
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,375
你要保护好现场嘛
You have to keep the scene intact.

454
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,917
你你你你...这走来走去的，现场都破坏了
The scene is ruined with people walking around.

455
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,292
遭抢的是隔壁手机店，不是这儿
It was the phone store next door got robbed, not here.

456
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,250
手机店?
The phone store?

457
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,147
拿枪抢劫手机店?
They robbed a phone store with a gun?

458
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,500
所以说我说是两个憨贼哒嘛
That's how I say they're retarded.

459
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,708
你说两个憨贼拿着枪...
You said the robbers were holding a gun?

460
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,832
你看到没得那个枪是啥子样子？
Have you seen how the gun looked like?

461
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,042
肯定看到了撒
Of course I have.

462
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,750
老子正好出来
I just came out,

463
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,600
那个憨贼还拿枪对到我
And that idiot had his gun pointing at me.

464
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,291
嘿的我转身就跑
That scared shit out of me so I ran inside.

465
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,374
我一想不对
But I thought that wasn't enough,

466
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,583
我又回来把铁门把它关起了
So I came back to shut the gate.

467
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,413
枪是啥样子?
How did the gun looks like?

468
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
你是哪个?
Who are you?

469
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,792
我是哪个?
Who am I?

470
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,833
你说我是哪个？
Don't you know who I am?

471
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,042
枪啊
The gun,

472
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,417
枪有点长
Was a bit long.

473
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,667
大概那么长的样子
About this long.

474
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,832
就像是寨子里头的土猎枪
Just like those shotguns for hunting you'd find in villages.

475
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,875
土猎枪?
A shotgun for hunting?

476
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:21,166
那两个憨贼还在手机店里放了一枪
Those two idiots fired a shot in the shop.

477
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,249
放了一枪?
They fired a shot?

478
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,250
诶
Yeah.

479
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:24,417
还有呢?
What else?

480
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,167
没得了
That's it.

481
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,333
再想想
Think harder.

482
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:27,833
真勒没得了
Nothing else.

483
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:31,667
搞啥子？

You dumb idiot.

抢手机店儿勒头盔侠？

00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,417
你们两个憨批
You two dumbasses.

737
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,625
她是不是，在嘲笑我们?
Is she laughing at us?

738
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:09,916
今晚九点的烟花晚会…

你又不戴眼镜儿
Why does he call you Bra?

751
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,833
为啥要叫眼镜儿喃？
You're not wearing one.

752
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:41,958
你梳个鸡冠头
Why not Chicken-head?

753
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,542
为啥子不叫鸡冠呢？
It fits your hairstyle.

754
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,250
小的时候
When we were kids,

755
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:47,416
他一个人打死了一条眼镜蛇
He killed a cobra all by himself.

756
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,791
村里头的人觉得他霸道得很
Everyone in the village thought he's so tough,

757
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,083
就称呼他眼镜蛇，眼镜蛇
We called him Cobra since then,

758
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,500
后来叫着叫着，就变成眼镜儿了
And it gradually became Bra.

759
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:55,750
霸不霸道？
Tough, huh?

760
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,958
你给她两个说这些咋子？
Why do you tell her that?

761
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,082
这些翻都翻篇了的老事情
Old stories should be left behind.

762
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,625
就莫再提了
Stop dredging them up.

763
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,375
不要跟她两个说话
Don't talk to her.

764
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:04,958
好
Fine.

765
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,333
你吃不吃饭？
Do you want some food?

766
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,166
欸老子喊你不要张她
I said don't talk to her!

00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,292
好好好
Fine.

768
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,792
吃的饭都是人家的
We're dining in her place.

769
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,500
谢谢啊
Thank you.

770
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,499
你说
Tell me,

771
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,041
这笔手机...
How much can we get

772
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,500
我们卖好多钱呢？
when we sell off these phones?

773
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,208
目前不好说
Can't tell yet,

774
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,082
但是保守估计...
But a conservative estimate would be

775
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,542
20万是应该有的
At least two hundred thousand.

776
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,667
二十万?
Two hundred thousand?

777
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,917
一人一半的话，一人10万嘛
If I get a half share, it makes a hundred thousand.

778
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,208
8万来装修房子
Eighty thousand to redecorate the house;

779
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,958
两万钱做彩礼
Twenty thousand for bride token.

780
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,333
7万块钱装修房子
Or seventy thousand for redecoration;

781
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,250
2万块钱做彩礼
Twenty thousand for bride token;

782
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,625
1万钱买棒棒糖
Ten thousand for lollipops.

783
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,833
霞爱特别爱吃棒棒糖
Xia loves lollipops.

784
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,708
我要跟你说好多回
I've told you millions of times,

785
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,542
她不可能嫁给你
She won't marry you.

786
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:00,958
更别说跟你回乡下去过日子
Let alone going back to the village with you.

787
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,167
唉，你那么肯定啊?
Why are you so sure?

788
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,082
以前是没得钱
We didn't have money before,

789
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,500
现在有钱了
But now we do,

790
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,750
情况就不一样了嘛
That makes a difference.

791
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,374
这不光是钱的问题，兄弟
It's not about money, dude.

792
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,000
她为啥子要进城？
Why did she come to the city?

793
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,917
我们为啥子要进城？
Why did we come to the city?

794
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,542
就是在乡下待不下去了撒
Because we couldn't live in the village.

795
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:20,666
人往高出走
Water streams downwards

796
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,416
水往低处流
While men strive for somewhere higher.

797
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,541
说白了，进城就是要换个活法
A city life is a different way of living,

798
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:25,833
就是要板命
We'll have to fight for it.

799
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,292
而且我们现在第一枪已经打响了
Our very first shot has been fired,

800
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,167
接下来应该啷个做
Here's what we gonna do next.

801
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,999
等这批货一出手
As soon as we manage to sell the goods,

802
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,917
先拿钱把装备更新
We'll use the money to upgrade our gears,

803
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,125
摩托车、
Motorcycles,

804
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:37,759

Helmets,

805
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,208
子弹、
Bullets,

806
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,208
枪！
Guns.

807
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,167
老子整把AK
I'll get an AK for myself,

808

给你弄把来福
And a rifle for you.

809
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,668
日你的魂哦

812
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,288
六万块钱装修房子应该够了哇?
Is sixty thousand enough for redecorating the house?

813

办大事，办大事，办大事！
Ambition, ambition!

814
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,167

娶霞妹儿就是我最大的事
Marrying Xia is my biggest ambition.

816
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,167
抢都抢了
Since you're robbers,

817
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,708
为啥子不抢银行，要抢个手机店儿啊
Why didn't you rob the bank, but a phone store instead?

818
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,666
手机店儿好抢
It's easier to rob a phone store.

819
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:06,625
没有保安
There's no security guard.

820
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,291
就是不敢抢银行嘛
So you don't have the guts to rob banks.

821
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,667
还不承认
Admit it.

822
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,082
是的，就是不敢
No, we don't.

823
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,332
谁说不敢？
Who said it?

824
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,583
老子啥子不敢
Of course we do,

825
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,417
时机还没有成熟哒嘛
But it's not yet the right time.

826
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,375
我们现在刚刚入行
We're newcomers in this business,

827
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,500
起步要稳
We need a solid start,

828
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,125
一步一个脚印儿的来
And achieve higher step by step.

829
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,832

一步一个脚印儿的来
Step by step.

831
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,667
我要是你们
If I were you,

832
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,107
第一步抢劫
I'll take robbery as the first step,

833
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,833
第二步，就是应该杀人
And murder the second step.

834
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,875
你为啥子，非要我们杀你喃？
Why do you want us to kill you so badly?

835
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,000
你有好想结婚，我就有好想死
I want to die as much as you want to marry your girl;

836
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,208
你有好想当大哥，我就有好想死
As much as you want to be the big brother.

837
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:44,374
你们一枪打死我你们就可以出去了
You guys can go out once you shoot me dead.

838
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,458
一步一步，做大做强。
Step by step, bigger and stronger.

839
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,208
而且我跟你们说
I'll tell you what,

840
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,666
你们杀死我是做好事
Killing me is like doing justice.

841
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,333
是助人为乐，传出去不丢人
It's not shameful to let people know you're helping people.

842
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,083
而且我还可以把我的钱都给你们
I can give you all my money as well.

843
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,666
一举两得
It's kill two birds with one stone.

844
00:39:58,667 --> 00:39:59,667
三得~
Three birds!

845
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,500
我说的有没有道理
Does that make sense?

846
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,042
你们个人想一下
Think about it.

847
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,625
你们不打死我
You can't go

848
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:09,082
你们就走不到哦
If you don't kill me.

849
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,333
你走我就喊
I'll shout if you try to leave,

850
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,874
一喊你们又出不门去了
Then you'll have to stay here for longer.

851
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:13,667
结果就是
The three of us

852
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,624
下半辈子我们三个就在这个屋头
Will end up in this flat.

853
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,917
相依为命
We'll feed each other,

854
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:18,254
等死
While waiting for death.

855
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,583
我是无所谓哈，我习惯了
I'm already quite used to it,

But you, curly hair,

你不是想结婚吗?
Don't you want to get married?

你想结婚你只能和我结婚
You'll have to marry me instead.

Chicken-head,

你不是想当大哥么
Don't you want to be the big brother?

你要当大哥
The curly hair

00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:32,082
你只能当卷毛毛儿勒大哥
Will be your only gangman,

863
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,125

各自欢喜

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,750
人生就像一场戏
'All the world's a stage'

877
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,332
因为有缘才相遇
'Men and women merely players'

878
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,916
别人生气我不气
'But if you're in rage'

879

但是也不是没得漏洞
But it doesn't mean your logic's perfect.

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,542
等于是你永远不会睡着么？

警察叔叔，我真的没有抢劫

以后，再敢欺负真真

警察真的会这样问话？
That's how real cops interrogate people?

两个人光起身子不嫖娼咋子安？

Are you a pervert, daddy?

你妹不嫁给我
Why the hell should I lend you all that,

1115
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:19,792
我借个毛给你
If your sister's not marrying me?

我听说人要下去了
I heard that one has to cross a bridge

1421

1596
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:26,957
老子是你哥

你睁眼

你搁浅
You then stranded

1816
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:37,500
沉默着
In the silence

1817
01:41:39,458 --> 01:41:42,875
都幻灭
Everything is disillusioned

1818
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:50,750
在沉浮之间寻找爱的光线
Seeking love's sliver line between ups and downs

1819
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:56,042
阴霾边沿触碰蓝天
The edge of gray haze touched the blue sky

1820
01:41:56,083 --> 01:42:00,125
像烟火炙热
Bursting like fireworks

1821
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,792
瞬间
Burning

1822
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:10,957
破碎的梦还在不在
Are those broken dreams still here

1823
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:16,417
还给明天一场未来
To bring tomorrow with a future

1824
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:21,703
生命如何充满无奈
Since life is filled with resignation

1825
01:42:21,703 --> 01:42:21,707
生命如何充满无奈
We should make it bloom in profusion

1826
01:42:21,707 --> 01:42:21,708
We should make it bloom in profusion

1827
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:27,495
就当如何怒放精彩
We should make it bloom in profusion

1828
01:42:27,495 --> 01:42:27,500
就当如何怒放精彩

1829
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:28,750
这一个
This

1830
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:31,542
愤怒的疯狂的无名之辈
Angry and crazy cool little fish

1831
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:34,083
执着的刚强的不知后退
Persists and doesn't know how to retreat

1832
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:36,541
坚持着对抗着心中错对
Fights against the wrong in his heart

1833
01:42:36,542 --> 01:42:39,416
粉身也不下跪
He refused to kneel, rather be smashed to pieces

1834
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:42,083
卑微的骄傲的我的同类
This humble but proud fish is of my own kind

1835
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:44,749
眼神里不灭的生的光辉
The halo of life sparks in his eyes

1836
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,167
誓不做我们世界的鸡肋
He swears not to be encumbrance of our world

1837
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:52,458
碎骨有何可畏
Then what's the fear of break apart

1838
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,167
你抬头
You look up

1839
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:03,792
向自由
To the freedom

1840
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:09,208
放开手
You let go

1841
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:14,417
去拥有
To embrace it

1842
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:21,332
在沉浮之间寻找爱的光线
Seeking love's sliver line between ups and downs

1843
01:43:21,334 --> 01:43:26,625
阴霾边沿触碰蓝天
The edge of gray haze touched the blue sky

1844
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:30,917
像烟火炙热
Bursting like fireworks

1845
01:43:31,792 --> 01:43:35,958
瞬间
Burning

1846
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:41,749
穿过这片幽暗的海
Passing through this shadowy sea

1847
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:47,167
还给明天一场痛快
To bring tomorrow with gratification

1848
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:52,417
黑暗中寂静的等待
Wait silently in the dark

1849
01:43:52,458 --> 01:43:58,207
渺小的梦终会盛开
Even the smallest dream shall blossom

1850
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,332
这一个
This

1851
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:02,208
愤怒的疯狂的无名之辈
Angry and crazy cool little fish

1852
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:04,666
执着的刚强的不知后退
Persists and doesn't know how to retreat

1853
01:44:04,667 --> 01:44:07,208
坚持着对抗着心中错对
Fights against the wrong in his heart

1854
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:10,042
粉身也不下跪
He refused to kneel, rather be smashed to pieces

1855
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:12,542
卑微的骄傲的我的同类
This humble but proud fish is of my own kind

1856
01:44:12,583 --> 01:44:15,332
眼神里不灭的生的光辉
The halo of life sparks in his eyes

1857
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,917
誓不做我们世界的鸡肋
He swears not to be encumbrance of our world

1858
